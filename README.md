# DeLPhos
Powershell based DLP testing tool.

run ./delphos.ps1 once you have edited it to execute the various tests you wish. Requires MS Office (presently).

Super 'hacky' and a lot of code from various places, but it works, so please be gentle! ;) 

Some scripts may require some raw data in a csv format if it doesn't generate it - should be easy to find online (Fake PCI/Credit card generator)
